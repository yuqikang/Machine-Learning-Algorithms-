 Different Machine Learning Algorithms applied for a stock market dataset
 
 
## Cross Validation

### The Validation Set Approach
split a dataset into fixed amount of training dataset and testing dataset

### K-Fold CV
k-fold cv involves randomly dividing the set of observations into k groups of approximately equal size. 

### Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)
loocv involes spliting the set of observations into two parts. However, instead of creating two subsets of comparable size, a single observation (x, y) is used for the validation set, and the training observation make up the training set.
